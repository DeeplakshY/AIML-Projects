I developed a Diabetes Prediction model using Machine Learning. Leveraging powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, I was able to preprocess the data, build the model, and achieve significant insights.

This experience has been incredibly rewarding and has deepened my understanding of how ML can be applied to real-world health challenges. Looking forward to the next tasks and continuing this amazing journey in AI and ML! ðŸŒŸ
